# Legacy Placeholder Site

This is a minimal Jekyll site that serves as a placeholder at [legacy.risangbaskoro.com](https://legacy.risangbaskoro.com).

## Purpose

This repository exists as a fallback site that will be activated by a Dead Man's Switch workflow. Its sole purpose is to redirect visitors to the main website at: [risangbaskoro.com](https://risangbaskoro.com)

## How it works

- The site contains only a single HTML page (`index.md`) that performs an immediate redirect.
- It is hosted using a static hosting service.
- It is not intended for regular updates—just to serve as a passive redirect mechanism to the main site **until the Dead Man’s Switch is triggered**.
